# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Resources
Read or watch:

    C - Pointer to Pointer
    C  Pointer to Pointer with example
    Multi-dimensional Arrays in C
    Two dimensional (2D) arrays in C programming with example
    pointers and arrays

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General


    What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
    What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
    What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

## Requirements

### General


    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc is forbidden
    You are allowed to use _putchar
    You dont have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it wont be taken into account
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you dont have to push them to your repo (if you do we wont take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
    Dont forget to push your header file


## More Info

You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, arrays of structures, malloc and free - yet.
